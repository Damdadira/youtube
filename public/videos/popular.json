        "title": "P1Harmony (피원하모니) - ‘DUH!’ MV",
        "description": "P1Harmony (피원하모니) - ‘DUH!’ MV\n\n[Apple Music] : https://music.apple.com/kr/album/duh-ep/1811491701\n[Melon] : https://www.melon.com/album/detail.htm?albumId=11798745\n[Spotify] : https://open.spotify.com/album/31Q4mSPAjzNEwqSwyBzW5p\n\n매 앨범 커리어 하이를 기록하며 놀라운 성장세를 보여 주는 그룹 P1Harmony(피원하모니)가 5월 8일 여덟 번째 미니 앨범 ‘DUH!’로 돌아왔다. \n\n전작에서 HERO가 느끼는 슬픔과 공허함, 영웅의 이면을 조명하며 극복의 힘을 노래했던 피원하모니는 새 앨범을 통해 영웅의 또 다른 면모를 보여 준다. 미니 8집 ‘DUH!’는 자신들을 필요로 하지 않는 사람들에게 “이렇게 멋있는 우리가 필요 없다고?”라고 반문하며 파업을 선언한 영웅, 피원하모니의 모습을 그린다. HERO는 언제나 정의롭다는 고정 관념을 깨고 하고 싶은 대로 행동하는 피원하모니의 모습을 위트 있게 풀어낸다. \n\n동명의 타이틀곡은 이번 앨범이 담고 있는 이야기를 관통한다. ‘DUH!’는 빈티지한 비트가 주는 레트로한 매력과 피원하모니의 트렌디한 보컬이 어우러진 곡이다. 특히 제목인 ‘DUH!’는 ‘이 잘나가는 사람이 누구야? 당연히 나지! 뭘 그런 걸 물어!’의 뉘앙스를 가진 영어 표현으로, HERO인 나 자신을 조금 더 과시하고 이 상황을 당연하게 받아들이는 모습을 재치 있게 표현했다. 정의롭고 겸손한 기존의 HERO와는 다르게, ‘내가 앉는 자리, 내가 걸어가는 길이 답’이라는 내용으로 남다른 존재감을 나타낸다.\n\n퍼포먼스는 프리스타일 댄스에 중점을 두며, 기존의 퍼포먼스보다 더 새롭고 힙한 느낌을 가미했다. 후렴구의 ‘DUH!’ 포인트 안무는 인탁이 아이디어를 내어 제작되었다. 또한 소울이 마지막 후렴 부분 안무에 직접 참여하며 피원하모니의 색깔을 확실하게 부각시킨다. 특히 ‘DUH!’ 퍼포먼스는 같은 동작도 멤버마다 다른 느낌으로 볼 수 있다는 재미가 있으며, 멤버 각각의 개성이 도드라지는 프리스타일 댄스를 즐길 수 있다는 점이 포인트로 작용한다. \n\nP1Harmony, a group that continues to break own records with every release, is back with 8th Mini Album “DUH!” on May 8th. \n\nIn previous album, P1Harmony explored the loneliness and emptiness felt by a HERO, shedding light on the hidden struggles behind heroism and unveiling yet another side of the HERO. The 8th Mini Album, 'DUH!' introduces a HERO who refuses to be taken for granted, boldly asking, “You really don’t need us?” and going on strike in response. It flips the idea that heroes must always be noble, instead portraying a bold, free-spirited side of P1Harmony with a playful twist.\n\nThe title track 'DUH!', which shares its name with the album, embodies the album's core message. Built on a vintage beat with a retro-inspired groove, the song merges old-school charm with P1Harmony’s trendsetting vocal style. The title track 'DUH!' is an expression conveying the attitude of \"Who’s the big shot here? Of course, it’s me! Isn’t that obvious?\" and playfully showcases a more self-assured and bold version of the HERO. Unlike the traditional HERO, who is righteous and humble, this HERO asserts an undeniable presence with lines like \"Where I sit, and the path I walk is the answer.\"\n\nThe performance emphasizes freestyle dance, bringing fresh and hip vibes compared to previous routines. The key move of 'DUH!' was created by INTAK, while SOUL contributed to the choreography in the final chorus, further highlighting P1Harmony’s distinctive style. One of the performance’s highlights of 'DUH!' is how each member interprets the same movements in own unique way, making a dynamic and individualistic freestyle expression.\n\n▷OFFICIAL WEBSITE : https://www.fncent.com/P1Harmony\n▷OFFICIAL WEVERSE : https://www.weverse.io/p1harmony\n▷OFFICIAL X : https://x.com/P1H_official\n▷OFFICIAL MEMBERS X : https://x.com/P1H_members\n▷OFFICIAL INSTAGRAM : https://www.instagram.com/p1h_official\n▷OFFICIAL FACEBOOK : https://www.facebook.com/P1Harmony\n▷OFFICIAL TIKTOK : https://www.tiktok.com/@p1harmony\n▷OFFICIAL WEIBO : https://weibo.com/P1Harmony\n\n#P1Harmony #피원하모니 #P1H #DUH",

          "description": "P1Harmony (피원하모니) - ‘DUH!’ MV\n\n[Apple Music] : https://music.apple.com/kr/album/duh-ep/1811491701\n[Melon] : https://www.melon.com/album/detail.htm?albumId=11798745\n[Spotify] : https://open.spotify.com/album/31Q4mSPAjzNEwqSwyBzW5p\n\n매 앨범 커리어 하이를 기록하며 놀라운 성장세를 보여 주는 그룹 P1Harmony(피원하모니)가 5월 8일 여덟 번째 미니 앨범 ‘DUH!’로 돌아왔다. \n\n전작에서 HERO가 느끼는 슬픔과 공허함, 영웅의 이면을 조명하며 극복의 힘을 노래했던 피원하모니는 새 앨범을 통해 영웅의 또 다른 면모를 보여 준다. 미니 8집 ‘DUH!’는 자신들을 필요로 하지 않는 사람들에게 “이렇게 멋있는 우리가 필요 없다고?”라고 반문하며 파업을 선언한 영웅, 피원하모니의 모습을 그린다. HERO는 언제나 정의롭다는 고정 관념을 깨고 하고 싶은 대로 행동하는 피원하모니의 모습을 위트 있게 풀어낸다. \n\n동명의 타이틀곡은 이번 앨범이 담고 있는 이야기를 관통한다. ‘DUH!’는 빈티지한 비트가 주는 레트로한 매력과 피원하모니의 트렌디한 보컬이 어우러진 곡이다. 특히 제목인 ‘DUH!’는 ‘이 잘나가는 사람이 누구야? 당연히 나지! 뭘 그런 걸 물어!’의 뉘앙스를 가진 영어 표현으로, HERO인 나 자신을 조금 더 과시하고 이 상황을 당연하게 받아들이는 모습을 재치 있게 표현했다. 정의롭고 겸손한 기존의 HERO와는 다르게, ‘내가 앉는 자리, 내가 걸어가는 길이 답’이라는 내용으로 남다른 존재감을 나타낸다.\n\n퍼포먼스는 프리스타일 댄스에 중점을 두며, 기존의 퍼포먼스보다 더 새롭고 힙한 느낌을 가미했다. 후렴구의 ‘DUH!’ 포인트 안무는 인탁이 아이디어를 내어 제작되었다. 또한 소울이 마지막 후렴 부분 안무에 직접 참여하며 피원하모니의 색깔을 확실하게 부각시킨다. 특히 ‘DUH!’ 퍼포먼스는 같은 동작도 멤버마다 다른 느낌으로 볼 수 있다는 재미가 있으며, 멤버 각각의 개성이 도드라지는 프리스타일 댄스를 즐길 수 있다는 점이 포인트로 작용한다. \n\nP1Harmony, a group that continues to break own records with every release, is back with 8th Mini Album “DUH!” on May 8th. \n\nIn previous album, P1Harmony explored the loneliness and emptiness felt by a HERO, shedding light on the hidden struggles behind heroism and unveiling yet another side of the HERO. The 8th Mini Album, 'DUH!' introduces a HERO who refuses to be taken for granted, boldly asking, “You really don’t need us?” and going on strike in response. It flips the idea that heroes must always be noble, instead portraying a bold, free-spirited side of P1Harmony with a playful twist.\n\nThe title track 'DUH!', which shares its name with the album, embodies the album's core message. Built on a vintage beat with a retro-inspired groove, the song merges old-school charm with P1Harmony’s trendsetting vocal style. The title track 'DUH!' is an expression conveying the attitude of \"Who’s the big shot here? Of course, it’s me! Isn’t that obvious?\" and playfully showcases a more self-assured and bold version of the HERO. Unlike the traditional HERO, who is righteous and humble, this HERO asserts an undeniable presence with lines like \"Where I sit, and the path I walk is the answer.\"\n\nThe performance emphasizes freestyle dance, bringing fresh and hip vibes compared to previous routines. The key move of 'DUH!' was created by INTAK, while SOUL contributed to the choreography in the final chorus, further highlighting P1Harmony’s distinctive style. One of the performance’s highlights of 'DUH!' is how each member interprets the same movements in own unique way, making a dynamic and individualistic freestyle expression.\n\n▷OFFICIAL WEBSITE : https://www.fncent.com/P1Harmony\n▷OFFICIAL WEVERSE : https://www.weverse.io/p1harmony\n▷OFFICIAL X : https://x.com/P1H_official\n▷OFFICIAL MEMBERS X : https://x.com/P1H_members\n▷OFFICIAL INSTAGRAM : https://www.instagram.com/p1h_official\n▷OFFICIAL FACEBOOK : https://www.facebook.com/P1Harmony\n▷OFFICIAL TIKTOK : https://www.tiktok.com/@p1harmony\n▷OFFICIAL WEIBO : https://weibo.com/P1Harmony\n\n#P1Harmony #피원하모니 #P1H #DUH"
